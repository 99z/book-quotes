# book-quotes
A collection of quotes from books I've read organized as flat files & folders

## Motivation
After trying many times to switch to reading books parimarily on an ereader or tablet I've found I just don't enjoy it as much. They do provide one great convenience though - capturing all my highlights and notes in one place and having them be searchable.

## Organization
To get the best of both worlds, I type out quotes or passages that stand out to me along with any notes I may have. Each quote is stored as a flat text file in a subdirectory for that particular book, which may include a directory for chapters. I had originally been doing something similar with Emacs and Org-mode but would rather not rely on having to use Emacs to comfortably search and organize the quotes, especially since it is not my primary text editor.

The general structure is as follows:

`classification/genre or topic/title/(chapter)/.quote files`

The first and sometimes only file in a book's directory is the `_info` file. These files include book title, author(s), and ISBN number.

I add the `.md` suffix to all `.quote` files to make them nicer to read on github.

The title of a `.quote` file is what the quote is about to me. Since I haven't been keeping track of page numbers up until now many quotes won't have them, but going forward I'll add page number as a prefix like so: `241_duality.quote`.

I intend to include chapters subdirectories from now on. Unfortunately, like page numbers, I haven't been keeping track of chapters, so some books will be missing them.

Any notes I have appear in the `.quote` file below the quote itself, on a new line.
