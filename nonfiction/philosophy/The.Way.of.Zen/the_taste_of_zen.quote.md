>A legend says that [Bodhidharma] once fell asleep in meditation and was so furious that he cut off his eyelids, and falling to they ground they arose as the first tea plant. Tea has thereafter supplied Zen monks with a protection against sleep, and so clarifies and invigorates the mind that it has been said, 'The taste of Zen and the taste of tea are the same.'
