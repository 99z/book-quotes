>The attempt to work on one's own mind is a vicious cycle. To try to purify it is to be contaminated with purity. Obviously this is the Taoist philosophy of naturalness, according to which a person is not genuinely free, detached, or pure when his state is the result of an artificial discipline. He is just imitating purity, just 'faking' clear awareness. Hence the unpleasant self-righteousness of those who are deliberately and methodically religious.
