>Our grievance is not just against Unix itself, but against the cult of Unix zealots who defend and nurture it. They take the heat, disease and pestilence as givens, and, as ancient shamans did, display their wounds, some self-inflicted, as proof of their power and wizardry. We aim, through bluntness and humor, to show them that they pray to a tin god, and that science, not religion, is the path to useful and friendly technology.
