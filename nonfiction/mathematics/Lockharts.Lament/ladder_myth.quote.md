>This is ultimately what I call 'the ladder myth' - the idea that mathematics can be arranged as a sequence of 'subjects' each being in some way more advanced, or 'higher' than the previous. The effect is to make school mathematics into a _race_ - some students are 'ahead' of others, and parents worry that their child is 'falling behind.' And where exactly does this race lead? What is waiting at the finish line? It's a sad race to nowhere. In the end you've been cheated out of a mathematical education, and you don't even know it.
