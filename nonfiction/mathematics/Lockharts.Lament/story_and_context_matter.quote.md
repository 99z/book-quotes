>Mathematical structures, useful or not, are invented and developed within a problem context, and derive their meaning from that context. Sometimes we want one plus one to equal zero (as in the so-called 'mod 2' arithmetic) and on the surface of a sphere the angles of a triangle add up to more than 180 degrees. There are no 'facts' per se; everything is relative and relational. It is the story that matters, not just the ending.
