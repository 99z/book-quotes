>Compare your own experience of learning algebra with Bertrand Russell's recollection:

>I was made to learn by heart: 'The square of the sum of two numbers is equal to the sum of their squares increased by twice their product.' I had not the vaguest idea what this meant and when I could not remember the words, my tutor threw the book at my head, which did not stimulate my intellect in any way.

>Are things really any different today?
